<a href="https://top-chatters.com">Top-Chatters</a> is a Website created by me to allow Twitch Streamers to reward their viewers for their chat participation.

This repository contains most of the front-end code of the Website.

Most of the noteable code is in <a href="/static/js/app.js">app.js</a>.
